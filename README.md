# herdr + file viewer (ttyd-in-iframe prototype)

A single Go binary that serves a two-column web UI:

- **Left** — `herdr` running inside a `ttyd` terminal, embedded in an `<iframe>`.
- **Right** — four tabs:
  - **Files** — a file browser that follows herdr's **focused pane** `cwd` live;
    click a file to open it full-screen with rich markdown preview and syntax
    highlighting (see [File viewer](#file-viewer)).
  - **Panes** — a grid of every herdr pane (click to focus it in the terminal,
    right-click to rename/close, ⌘/ctrl/shift-click to multi-select and bulk-close).
  - **Diff** — the git diff of the focused pane's repo (working tree, or the
    branch-vs-base diff when the tree is clean), in the spirit of Fulcrum's diff view.
  - **Browser** — an embedded `<iframe>` web preview with a URL bar, for viewing
    a dev server running in a pane.

  The column is collapsible via the `»` button in the tab strip (the terminal
  then fills the width); a floating `«` button brings it back. The state persists
  in `localStorage`. The divider between the panes is also drag-resizable.

The Go server reverse-proxies the terminal (WebSocket upgrade handled natively
by `httputil.ReverseProxy`) and talks to the herdr server over its
newline-delimited JSON unix socket — subscribing to `pane.focused` /
`tab.focused` / `workspace.focused` events and polling `pane.list` as a fallback
for plain `cd`s — then pushes active-pane state to the browser over SSE.

## Run

```bash
go build -o ttyd-iframe-demo .
./ttyd-iframe-demo            # spawns ttyd+herdr on loopback, serves UI on 127.0.0.1:8090
```

Open <http://localhost:8090>.

## Theming (follows herdr)

Both panes adopt whichever theme you've selected in `~/.config/herdr/config.toml`
(`[theme].name`), so the demo matches herdr instead of hardcoding one palette.
herdr exposes no theme method on its socket, so the server resolves the theme at
startup the same way herdr does: it reads the configured **name**, applies any
`[theme.custom]` per-token overrides, then the legacy `[ui].accent`. Built-ins:
`catppuccin`, `tokyo-night`, `dracula`, `nord`, `gruvbox`, `one-dark`,
`solarized`, `kanagawa`, `rose-pine`, `vesper`, `terminal` (unknown → catppuccin,
herdr's default).

- The **sidebar** CSS variables come from herdr's own 16-token UI palette
  (transcribed from herdr's source), so the chrome matches herdr's chrome.
- The **terminal** (xterm.js, via ttyd `-t theme=`) gets its background /
  foreground / cursor from those same UI tokens (so the iframe blends with
  herdr) plus the scheme's **canonical 16-color ANSI palette** (so colored output
  inside panes — git, `ls`, agents — looks right).

Note herdr paints most of its own TUI chrome with explicit RGB, independent of
the xterm palette; the xterm theme mainly governs the default background and the
ANSI colors that programs running *inside* a pane emit. Force a specific theme
with `-theme <name>` regardless of config.

**Live updates.** The theme is re-resolved on the same poll that tracks the
active pane (`-poll`, default 2 s), so editing `[theme].name` in
`config.toml` repaints the UI **without a restart** — no need to even
`herdr server reload-config`. When the resolved palette changes the server
bumps a `theme_rev` on the SSE stream; the browser then fetches `/api/theme`
and (a) rewrites the injected `:root` variables — which cascades to the
sidebar, file viewer, diff and markdown — and (b) sets `term.options.theme`
on the embedded xterm.js instance (ttyd exposes it as `window.term`, and the
iframe is same-origin), so the **live terminal repaints in place** with no
reconnect and no lost scrollback.

## Active-pane cwd tracking (and the agent-pane caveat)

herdr's `pane.cwd` is the **shell's** cwd (tracked via OSC 7). For plain shell
panes that's live and correct. But once an **agent** (e.g. `claude`) becomes the
pane's foreground process, the shell stops emitting OSC 7, so herdr's `cwd`
freezes at the shell's launch dir (often `/home/<user>`) — the file viewer would
then show the wrong directory.

herdr exposes no pane→PID key, so for agent panes the server recovers the real
cwd from `/proc`: it matches the herdr **tab label** against the agent process's
command line (whose first non-flag arg is the task title) and reads that
process's `/proc/<pid>/cwd`. The result is surfaced with a provenance badge:

- **`cwd ✓ process`** — real cwd, resolved from the agent process.
- **`⚠ shell cwd`** — agent pane the resolver couldn't pin (ambiguous/no match);
  showing herdr's stale shell dir. Use the path box.
- *(blank)* — a shell pane; herdr's cwd is trusted.

The UI always offers a manual **path box** and a **⟳ active** button, so a stale
guess is never a dead end. Disable the `/proc` step with `-proc-cwd=false`.

## Pane grid (the Panes tab)

The right column's **Panes** tab lists every herdr pane as a card, grouped by
workspace, showing the tab label, cwd, and (for agent panes) the agent + status.
The focused pane is highlighted, and that highlight stays in sync with herdr
however focus changes — clicking a card, or navigating directly in the terminal
(the highlight follows the same SSE focus stream the Files view uses).

**Click** a card to focus that pane in the terminal. herdr's socket has **no
`pane.focus`** method, so the server focuses a pane by calling `workspace.focus`
then `tab.focus` (panes are one-per-tab in the common case; for a split tab this
focuses the tab the pane belongs to). The grid is fetched on tab open and via
its **⟳** refresh button.

The grid also **re-syncs live** to match herdr's layout. The server computes a
*layout signature* — the workspace order (each workspace's `number` + id +
label) plus pane→workspace/tab membership — and bumps a `panes_rev` counter on
the SSE stream whenever it changes. So when you **reorder workspaces** in herdr
(their `number`s flip, which the grid sorts by), or rename a workspace, or add/
remove a pane, the open grid reloads itself into the new order — no manual
refresh. The signature deliberately omits focus and cwd, so a plain focus move
just slides the highlight instead of rebuilding the grid. herdr's socket exposes
no workspace-reorder *method* (reordering happens in its TUI), so this is driven
by the `workspace.updated` event, with the 2 s poll as a backstop.

**Right-click** a card for a context menu:

- **Rename…** prompts for a new name and calls `tab.rename` — the cards are
  labeled by their *tab*, and `pane.rename` sets a pane name herdr never
  surfaces, so renaming the tab is what actually relabels the card (the change
  shows up in herdr's own tab bar too).
- **Close pane** closes that pane (`pane.close`); closing the last pane in a tab
  closes the tab.

**Multi-select** with ⌘/ctrl/shift-click (a plain click still just focuses).
Selected cards get an accent ring + ✓ badge, and a selection bar appears with
**Close selected** (and **Clear**). Bulk close calls `pane.close` per id and
reports any partial failures; the selection is pruned to still-present panes on
every refresh, so a pane that vanished underneath you is closed cleanly (its
stale id just comes back as a reported error). Close is **confirmed** first
since it terminates the terminal — and any agent running in it.

## File viewer

Clicking a file in the **Files** tab opens it in a viewer that **fills the right
column** — the terminal stays visible on the left (← / ✕ / Esc returns to the
list), modeled on Fulcrum's replace-view editor:

- **Markdown** (`.md`, `.markdown`, …) renders as rich formatted HTML via
  [marked](https://marked.js.org), sanitized with
  [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cypress-io/dompurify) and themed to match herdr.
  A **Raw** toggle flips between the rendered view and the highlighted source.
- **Code / text** is syntax-highlighted with
  [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org): the language is picked from the file
  extension (falling back to auto-detect), and the tokens are colored from the
  active herdr theme's palette — not a fixed highlight.js stylesheet — so the code
  matches everything else. Line wrapping is **on by default**; a **Wrap** toggle
  flips it (the choice persists in `localStorage`).
- **Images** render inline (on a checkerboard so transparency is visible).
- **↗** opens the raw file in a new browser tab.

These three libraries are **vendored** under `static/` and embedded into the
binary (`go:embed`), loaded lazily on the first file open — there's **no runtime
CDN dependency**, which suits a tailnet-only tool. Files over 2 MiB aren't
fetched (the server's preview cap); files over ~400 KiB are shown without
highlighting (a badge notes this) so a huge file doesn't hang the tab. Markdown
is sanitized because the viewer can open files from any repo, including untrusted
ones.

## Diff view (the Diff tab)

The **Diff** tab shows the git diff of the repository containing the focused
pane's `cwd` — it follows the active pane the same way the Files view does
(toggle **follow active pane** off to pin it). The server resolves the repo
root (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`) from that directory and builds the diff
the way Fulcrum's diff view does:

- **Working-tree changes** — staged (`git diff --cached`) + unstaged (`git diff`).
- **Branch-vs-base fallback** — if the tree is clean, it diffs against the
  merge-base with the default branch (`origin/HEAD`, else `main`/`master`), so a
  finished feature branch still shows its work. A `vs <base>` pill marks this mode.

The diff is parsed client-side into per-file blocks: each file is a collapsible
header with `+adds`/`−dels` counts, and the lines are colored (added/removed/
context/hunk) in the active theme. Toolbar toggles: **ignore whitespace** (`-w`),
**untracked** (synthesizes an all-added diff for untracked files, which `git diff`
omits), **wrap**, plus **collapse all** and a **⟳** refresh. Large diffs are
capped at 2 MiB (a `diff truncated` pill shows when that happens). The view
refreshes on tab open, on a cwd change (when following), and on demand.

## Browser pane (the Browser tab)

The **Browser** tab is a plain `<iframe>` web preview with a URL bar
(navigate, **⟳** reload, **↗** open-in-new-tab) — the same approach Fulcrum
takes. The default URL is `http://<this-host>:3000`, where `<this-host>` is
whatever you reached the UI on (the tailscale IP or MagicDNS name, via
`location.hostname`) and `3000` is the usual dev-server port; the last URL you
visit is remembered in `localStorage`.

Two caveats, both inherent to iframing:

- **Reachability** — the iframe loads from *your* browser, over the tailnet. A
  dev server bound to the VPS's `localhost` won't be reachable; bind it to the
  tailscale IP (or `0.0.0.0`) so the tailnet can see it. This is why the default
  points at the tailscale host, not `localhost`.
- **Framing** — sites that send `X-Frame-Options: DENY` / a restrictive
  `frame-ancestors` CSP won't render in the iframe (use **↗** to open them in a
  real tab). Dev servers generally don't set these, so previews work.

## Expose over Tailscale (plain HTTP, tailnet-only)

The left pane is a **writable shell**, so never bind to `0.0.0.0` (on a VPS that
is the *public* internet). Bind to the **tailscale interface IP** instead — only
your tailnet can reach it. Auth is required for any non-loopback bind (guard).

```bash
# tailnet-only, no auth (WireGuard already encrypts + authenticates the tailnet):
./ttyd-iframe-demo -listen "$(tailscale ip -4):8090" -insecure-no-auth

# or, to require a login as well, set creds via env (never argv) and drop the flag:
UI_AUTH="herdr:$(cat .authpass)" ./ttyd-iframe-demo -listen "$(tailscale ip -4):8090"
```

Then from any tailnet device: `http://<host>:8090/` (MagicDNS) — e.g.
`http://citadel:8090/`. No TLS needed; WireGuard already encrypts the tailnet.

## Security

- Binds to **loopback** by default; the terminal (ttyd) always stays on loopback.
- `UI_AUTH=user:pass` enables HTTP basic auth across the page, terminal, SSE and
  file APIs. The server **refuses to start** on a non-loopback `-listen` unless
  either `UI_AUTH` is set or `-insecure-no-auth` is passed — so it can never
  *accidentally* expose a bare writable shell on a public interface.
- `-insecure-no-auth` is intended only for a private interface (e.g. `tailscale0`),
  where the network itself provides authentication. Never use it on a public IP.
- `/api/file` reads any absolute path as the running user — fine on a private
  tailnet; confine it before widening access.

## Endpoints

- `GET /` — UI
- `/static/*` — vendored viewer libs (marked, highlight.js, DOMPurify), embedded
- `/terminal/*` — reverse proxy to ttyd
- `GET /api/active` — current focused pane `{cwd, workspace, tab, agent, ...}`
- `GET /api/events` — SSE stream of active-pane changes
- `GET /api/files?path=` — directory listing
- `GET /api/file?path=` — file preview (2 MiB cap)
- `GET /api/panes` — every pane with workspace/tab labels, agent, and focus state
- `POST /api/focus` — focus a pane `{workspace_id, tab_id}` (→ `workspace.focus` + `tab.focus`)
- `POST /api/rename` — rename a tab `{tab_id, label}` (→ `tab.rename`)
- `POST /api/close` — close panes `{pane_ids: [...]}` (→ `pane.close` each); returns `{closed, errors}`
- `GET /api/diff?path=&ignoreWhitespace=&includeUntracked=` — git diff of the repo containing `path`; returns `{repo, branch, diff, files, isBranchDiff, baseBranch, truncated}`
